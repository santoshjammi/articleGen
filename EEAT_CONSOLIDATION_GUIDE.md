# E-E-A-T System - Consolidated Usage Guide

## Overview
Your E-E-A-T scripts have been successfully consolidated into a single, unified system: `eeat_system.py`

This eliminates the need for multiple separate scripts and provides a streamlined workflow for Google's 2024-2025 E-E-A-T compliance.

## What Was Consolidated

### Old System (Multiple Files):
- ‚ùå `eeat_enhancer.py` - Article enhancement logic
- ‚ùå `eeat_site_enhancements.py` - HTML generation functions  
- ‚ùå `integrate_eeat.py` - Integration script

### New System (Single File):
- ‚úÖ `eeat_system.py` - Complete unified solution

## Usage Commands

### 1. Enhance Articles Only
```bash
python3 eeat_system.py enhance --input perplexityArticles.json
```
This creates `perplexityArticles_eeat_enhanced.json` with all E-E-A-T elements.

### 2. Generate Website with Enhanced Articles
```bash
python3 eeat_system.py generate --articles perplexityArticles_eeat_enhanced.json
```
This generates your website using the E-E-A-T enhanced articles.

### 3. Complete Process (Recommended)
```bash
python3 eeat_system.py full-process --input perplexityArticles.json
```
This does everything: enhances articles + generates website in one command.

## What the System Provides

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Single Point of Truth**: All E-E-A-T logic in one file
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Update one file instead of three
3. **Simplified Workflow**: One command for complete process  
4. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to manage multiple script dependencies
5. **Better Testing**: Single system to test and validate

## Next Steps

1. **Test the system** with your articles:
   ```bash
   python3 eeat_system.py full-process --input perplexityArticles.json
   ```

2. **Monitor Results**: Check search rankings over 4-8 weeks

3. **Regular Updates**: Run monthly to update fact-check dates

4. **Cleanup**: Once verified working, you can delete the backup folder

## Support
