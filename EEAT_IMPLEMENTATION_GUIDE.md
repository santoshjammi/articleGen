### Manual Integration Steps:

1. **Update your article template** to include E-E-A-T elements:
   ```html
   <!-- Add after the byline -->
   {eeat_author_box}
   
   <!-- Add after content -->
   {eeat_trust_indicators}
   ```

2. **Update your generate_article_pages function** to include:
   ```python
   eeat_author_box = generate_eeat_author_box(article)
   eeat_trust_indicators = generate_eeat_trust_indicators(article)
   ```

3. **Add to your HTML template .format() call**:
   ```python
   html_content = ARTICLE_PAGE_TEMPLATE.format(
       # ... existing parameters ...
       eeat_author_box=eeat_author_box,
       eeat_trust_indicators=eeat_trust_indicators,
       lastFactCheck=article.get('lastFactCheck', current_date)
   )
   ```
